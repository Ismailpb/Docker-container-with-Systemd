At first we need to create a file named "docker.mariadb.service" in the location "/lib/systemd/system"

Once the file is ready use the command

```
# docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
#
```
